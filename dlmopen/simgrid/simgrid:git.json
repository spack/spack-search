This is particularly interesting to study\nexisting MPI applications within the comfort of the simulator.\n\nTo get started with SMPI, you should head to :ref:`the SMPI tutorial\n<usecase_smpi>`. You may also want to read the `SMPI reference\narticle <https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01415484>`_ or these `introductory\nslides <http://simgrid.org/tutorials/simgrid-smpi-101.pdf>`_.  If you\nare new to MPI, you should first take our online `SMPI CourseWare\n<https://simgrid.github.io/SMPI_CourseWare/>`_. It consists in several\nprojects that progressively introduce the MPI concepts. It proposes to\nuse SimGrid and SMPI to run the experiments, but the learning\nobjectives are centered on MPI itself.\n\nOur goal is to enable the study of **unmodified MPI applications**.\nSome constructs and features are still missing, but we can probably\nadd them on demand.  If you already used MPI before, SMPI should sound\nvery familiar to you: Use smpicc instead of mpicc, and smpirun instead\nof mpirun. The main difference is that smpirun takes a :ref:`simulated\nplatform <platform>` as an extra parameter.\n\nFor **further scalability**, you may modify your code to speed up your\nstudies or save memory space.  Maximal **simulation accuracy**\nrequires some specific care from you.\n\n.. _SMPI_online:\n\n-----------------\nUsing SMPI online\n-----------------\n\nIn this mode, your application is actually executed. Every computation\noccurs for real while every communication is simulated. In addition,\nthe executions are automatically benchmarked so that their timings can\nbe applied within the simulator.\n\nSMPI can also go offline by replaying a trace. :ref:`Trace replay\n<SMPI_offline>` is usually ways faster than online simulation (because\nthe computation are skipped), but it can only applied to applications\nwith constant execution and communication patterns (for the exact same\nreason).\n\n...................\nCompiling your Code\n...................\n\nIf your application is in C, then simply use ``smpicc`` as a\ncompiler just like you use mpicc with other MPI implementations. This\nscript still calls your default compiler (gcc, clang, ...) and adds\nthe right compilation flags along the way. If your application is in\nC++, Fortran 77 or Fortran 90, use respectively ``smpicxx``,\n``smpiff`` or ``smpif90``.\n\nIf you use cmake, set the variables ``MPI_C_COMPILER``, ``MPI_CXX_COMPILER`` and\n``MPI_Fortran_COMPILER`` to the full path of smpicc, smpicxx and smpiff (or\nsmpif90), respectively. Example:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n   cmake -DMPI_C_COMPILER=/opt/simgrid/bin/smpicc -DMPI_CXX_COMPILER=/opt/simgrid/bin/smpicxx -DMPI_Fortran_COMPILER=/opt/simgrid/bin/smpiff .\n\n....................\nSimulating your Code\n....................\n\nUse the ``smpirun`` script as follows:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n   smpirun -hostfile my_hostfile.txt -platform my_platform.xml ./program -blah\n\n- ``my_hostfile.txt`` is a classical MPI hostfile (that is, this file\n  lists the machines on which the processes must be dispatched, one\n  per line)\n- ``my_platform.xml`` is a classical SimGrid platform file. Of course,\n  the hosts of the hostfile must exist in the provided platform.\n- ``./program`` is the MPI program to simulate, that you compiled with ``smpicc``\n- ``-blah`` is a command-line parameter passed to this program.\n\n``smpirun`` accepts other parameters, such as ``-np`` if you don't\nwant to use all the hosts defined in the hostfile, ``-map`` to display\non which host each rank gets mapped of ``-trace`` to activate the\ntracing during the simulation. You can get the full list by running\n``smpirun -help``\n\nFinally, you can pass :ref:`any valid SimGrid parameter <options>` to your\nprogram. In particular, you can pass ``--cfg=network/model:ns-3`` to\nswitch to use :ref:`model_ns3`. These parameters should be placed after\nthe name of your binary on the command line.\n\n...............................\nDebugging your Code within SMPI\n...............................\n\nIf you want to explore the automatic platform and deployment files\nthat are generated by ``smpirun``, add ``-keep-temps`` to the command\nline.\n\nYou can also run your simulation within valgrind or gdb using the\nfollowing commands. Once in GDB, each MPI ranks will be represented as\na regular thread, and you can explore the state of each of them as\nusual.\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n   smpirun -wrapper valgrind ...other args...\n   smpirun -wrapper \"gdb --args\" --cfg=contexts/factory:thread ...other args...\n\n.. _SMPI_use_colls:\n\n................................\nSimulating Collective Operations\n................................\n\nMPI collective operations are crucial to the performance of MPI\napplications and must be carefully optimized according to many\nparameters. Every existing implementation provides several algorithms\nfor each collective operation, and selects by default the best suited\none, depending on the sizes sent, the number of nodes, the\ncommunicator, or the communication library being used.  These\ndecisions are based on empirical results and theoretical complexity\nestimation, and are very different between MPI implementations. In\nmost cases, the users can also manually tune the algorithm used for\neach collective operation.\n\nSMPI can simulate the behavior of several MPI implementations:\nOpenMPI, MPICH, `STAR-MPI <http://star-mpi.sourceforge.net/>`_, and\nMVAPICH2. For that, it provides 115 collective algorithms and several\nselector algorithms, that were collected directly in the source code\nof the targeted MPI implementations.\n\nYou can switch the automatic selector through the\n``smpi/coll-selector`` configuration item. Possible values:\n\n - **ompi:** default selection logic of OpenMPI (version 3.1.2)\n - **mpich**: default selection logic of MPICH (version 3.3b)\n - **mvapich2**: selection logic of MVAPICH2 (version 1.9) tuned\n   on the Stampede cluster\n - **impi**: preliminary version of an Intel MPI selector (version\n   4.1.3, also tuned for the Stampede cluster). Due the closed source\n   nature of Intel MPI, some of the algorithms described in the\n   documentation are not available, and are replaced by mvapich ones.\n - **default**: legacy algorithms used in the earlier days of\n   SimGrid. Do not use for serious perform performance studies.\n\n.. todo:: default should not even exist.\n\n....................\nAvailable Algorithms\n....................\n\nYou can also pick the algorithm used for each collective with the\ncorresponding configuration item. For example, to use the pairwise\nalltoall algorithm, one should add ``--cfg=smpi/alltoall:pair`` to the\nline. This will override the selector (if any) for this algorithm.  It\nmeans that the selected algorithm will be used\n\n.. Warning:: Some collective may require specific conditions to be\n   executed correctly (for instance having a communicator with a power\n   of two number of nodes only), which are currently not enforced by\n   Simgrid. Some crashes can be expected while trying these algorithms\n   with unusual sizes/parameters\n\nMPI_Alltoall\n^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nMost of these are best described in `STAR-MPI's white paper <https://doi.org/10.1145/1183401.1183431>`_.\n\n - default: naive one, by default\n - ompi: use openmpi selector for the alltoall operations\n - mpich: use mpich selector for the alltoall operations\n - mvapich2: use mvapich2 selector for the alltoall operations\n - impi: use intel mpi selector for the alltoall operations\n - automatic (experimental): use an automatic self-benchmarking algorithm\n - bruck: Described by Bruck et.al. in `this paper <http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=642949>`_\n - 2dmesh: organizes the nodes as a two dimensional mesh, and perform allgather\n   along the dimensions\n - 3dmesh: adds a third dimension to the previous algorithm\n - rdb: recursive doubling: extends the mesh to a nth dimension, each one\n   containing two nodes\n - pair: pairwise exchange, only works for power of 2 procs, size-1 steps,\n   each process sends and receives from the same process at each step\n - pair_light_barrier: same, with small barriers between steps to avoid\n   contention\n - pair_mpi_barrier: same, with MPI_Barrier used\n - pair_one_barrier: only one barrier at the beginning\n - ring: size-1 steps, at each step a process send to process (n+i)%size, and receives from (n-i)%size\n - ring_light_barrier: same, with small barriers between some phases to avoid contention\n - ring_mpi_barrier: same, with MPI_Barrier used\n - ring_one_barrier: only one barrier at the beginning\n - basic_linear: posts all receives and all sends,\n   starts the communications, and waits for all communication to finish\n - mvapich2_scatter_dest: isend/irecv with scattered destinations, posting only a few messages at the same time\n\nMPI_Alltoallv\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n - default: naive one, by default\n - ompi: use openmpi selector for the alltoallv operations\n - mpich: use mpich selector for the alltoallv operations\n - mvapich2: use mvapich2 selector for the alltoallv operations\n - impi: use intel mpi selector for the alltoallv operations\n - automatic (experimental): use an automatic self-benchmarking algorithm\n - bruck: same as alltoall\n - pair: same as alltoall\n - pair_light_barrier: same as alltoall\n - pair_mpi_barrier: same as alltoall\n - pair_one_barrier: same as alltoall\n - ring: same as alltoall\n - ring_light_barrier: same as alltoall\n - ring_mpi_barrier: same as alltoall\n - ring_one_barrier: same as alltoall\n - ompi_basic_linear: same as alltoall\n\nMPI_Gather\n^^^^^^^^^^\n\n - default: naive one, by default\n - ompi: use openmpi selector for the gather operations\n - mpich: use mpich selector for the gather operations\n - mvapich2: use mvapich2 selector for the gather operations\n - impi: use intel mpi selector for the gather operations\n - automatic (experimental): use an automatic self-benchmarking algorithm which will iterate over all implemented versions and output the best\n - ompi_basic_linear: basic linear algorithm from openmpi, each process sends to the root\n - ompi_binomial: binomial tree algorithm\n - ompi_linear_sync: same as basic linear, but with a synchronization at the\n   beginning and message cut into two segments.\n - mvapich2_two_level: SMP-aware version from MVAPICH.

This specific\nversion will loop over all other implemented algorithm for this particular collective, and apply\nthem while benchmarking the time taken for each process. It will then output the quickest for\neach process, and the global quickest. This is still unstable, and a few algorithms which need\nspecific number of nodes may crash.\n\nAdding an algorithm\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nTo add a new algorithm, one should check in the src/smpi/colls folder\nhow other algorithms are coded. Using plain MPI code inside Simgrid\ncan't be done, so algorithms have to be changed to use smpi version of\nthe calls instead (MPI_Send will become smpi_mpi_send). Some functions\nmay have different signatures than their MPI counterpart, please check\nthe other algorithms or contact us using the `>SimGrid\ndevelopers mailing list <http://lists.gforge.inria.fr/mailman/listinfo/simgrid-devel>`_.\n\nExample: adding a \"pair\" version of the Alltoall collective.\n\n - Implement it in a file called alltoall-pair.c in the src/smpi/colls folder. This file should include colls_private.hpp.\n\n - The name of the new algorithm function should be smpi_coll_tuned_alltoall_pair, with the same signature as MPI_Alltoall.\n\n - Once the adaptation to SMPI code is done, add a reference to the file (\"src/smpi/colls/alltoall-pair.c\") in the SMPI_SRC part of the DefinePackages.cmake file inside buildtools/cmake, to allow the file to be built and distributed.\n\n - To register the new version of the algorithm, simply add a line to the corresponding macro in src/smpi/colls/cools.h ( add a \"COLL_APPLY(action, COLL_ALLTOALL_SIG, pair)\" to the COLL_ALLTOALLS macro ). The algorithm should now be compiled and be selected when using --cfg=smpi/alltoall:pair at runtime.\n\n - To add a test for the algorithm inside Simgrid's test suite, juste add the new algorithm name in the ALLTOALL_COLL list found inside teshsuite/smpi/CMakeLists.txt . When running ctest, a test for the new algorithm should be generated and executed. If it does not pass, please check your code or contact us.\n\n - Please submit your patch for inclusion in SMPI, for example through a pull request on GitHub or directly per email.\n\n\nTracing of Internal Communications\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nBy default, the collective operations are traced as a unique operation\nbecause tracing all point-to-point communications composing them could\nresult in overloaded, hard to interpret traces. If you want to debug\nand compare collective algorithms, you should set the\n``tracing/smpi/internals`` configuration item to 1 instead of 0.\n\nHere are examples of two alltoall collective algorithms runs on 16 nodes,\nthe first one with a ring algorithm, the second with a pairwise one.\n\n.. image:: /img/smpi_simgrid_alltoall_ring_16.png\n   :align: center\n\nAlltoall on 16 Nodes with the Ring Algorithm.\n\n.. image:: /img/smpi_simgrid_alltoall_pair_16.png\n   :align: center\n\nAlltoall on 16 Nodes with the Pairwise Algorithm.\n\n-------------------------\nWhat can run within SMPI?\n-------------------------\n\nYou can run unmodified MPI applications (both C/C++ and Fortran) within\nSMPI, provided that you only use MPI calls that we implemented. Global\nvariables should be handled correctly on Linux systems.\n\n....................\nMPI coverage of SMPI\n....................\n\nOur coverage of the interface is very decent, but still incomplete;\nGiven the size of the MPI standard, we may well never manage to\nimplement absolutely all existing primitives. Currently, we have\nalmost no support for I/O primitives, but we still pass a very large\namount of the MPICH coverage tests.\n\nThe full list of not yet implemented functions is documented in the\nfile `include/smpi/smpi.h\n<https://framagit.org/simgrid/simgrid/tree/master/include/smpi/smpi.h>`_\nin your version of SimGrid, between two lines containing the ``FIXME``\nmarker. If you really miss a feature, please get in touch with us: we\ncan guide you though the SimGrid code to help you implementing it, and\nwe'd be glad to integrate your contribution to the main project.\n\n.. _SMPI_what_globals:\n\n.................................\nPrivatization of global variables\n.................................\n\nConcerning the globals, the problem comes from the fact that usually,\nMPI processes run as real UNIX processes while they are all folded\ninto threads of a unique system process in SMPI. Global variables are\nusually private to each MPI process while they become shared between\nthe processes in SMPI.  The problem and some potential solutions are\ndiscussed in this article: `Automatic Handling of Global Variables for\nMulti-threaded MPI Programs\n<http://charm.cs.illinois.edu/newPapers/11-23/paper.pdf>` (note that\nthis article does not deal with SMPI but with a competing solution\ncalled AMPI that suffers of the same issue).  This point used to be\nproblematic in SimGrid, but the problem should now be handled\nautomatically on Linux.\n\nOlder versions of SimGrid came with a script that automatically\nprivatized the globals through static analysis of the source code. But\nour implementation was not robust enough to be used in production, so\nit was removed at some point. Currently, SMPI comes with two\nprivatization mechanisms that you can :ref:`select at runtime\n<cfg=smpi/privatization>`.  The dlopen approach is used by\ndefault as it is much faster and still very robust.  The mmap approach\nis an older approach that proves to be slower.\n\nWith the **mmap approach**, SMPI duplicates and dynamically switch the\n``.data`` and ``.bss`` segments of the ELF process when switching the\nMPI ranks. This allows each ranks to have its own copy of the global\nvariables.  No copy actually occurs as this mechanism uses ``mmap()``\nfor efficiency. This mechanism is considered to be very robust on all\nsystems supporting ``mmap()`` (Linux and most BSDs). Its performance\nis questionable since each context switch between MPI ranks induces\nseveral syscalls to change the ``mmap`` that redirects the ``.data``\nand ``.bss`` segments to the copies of the new rank. The code will\nalso be copied several times in memory, inducing a slight increase of\nmemory occupation.\n\nAnother limitation is that SMPI only accounts for global variables\ndefined in the executable. If the processes use external global\nvariables from dynamic libraries, they won't be switched\ncorrectly. The easiest way to solve this is to statically link against\nthe library with these globals. This way, each MPI rank will get its\nown copy of these libraries. Of course you should never statically\nlink against the SimGrid library itself.\n\nWith the **dlopen approach**, SMPI loads several copies of the same\nexecutable in memory as if it were a library, so that the global\nvariables get naturally duplicated. It first requires the executable\nto be compiled as a relocatable binary, which is less common for\nprograms than for libraries. But most distributions are now compiled\nthis way for security reason as it allows one to randomize the address\nspace layout. It should thus be safe to compile most (any?) program\nthis way.  The second trick is that the dynamic linker refuses to link\nthe exact same file several times, be it a library or a relocatable\nexecutable. It makes perfectly sense in the general case, but we need\nto circumvent this rule of thumb in our case. To that extend, the\nbinary is copied in a temporary file before being re-linked against.\n``dlmopen()`` cannot be used as it only allows 256 contextes, and as it\nwould also duplicate simgrid itself.\n\nThis approach greatly speeds up the context switching, down to about\n40 CPU cycles with our raw contextes, instead of requesting several\nsyscalls with the ``mmap()`` approach. Another advantage is that it\npermits one to run the SMPI contexts in parallel, which is obviously not\npossible with the ``mmap()`` approach. It was tricky to implement, but\nwe are not aware of any flaws, so smpirun activates it by default.\n\nIn the future, it may be possible to further reduce the memory and\ndisk consumption. It seems that we could `punch holes\n<https://lwn.net/Articles/415889/>`_ in the files before dl-loading\nthem to remove the code and constants, and mmap these area onto a\nunique copy. If done correctly, this would reduce the disk- and\nmemory- usage to the bare minimum, and would also reduce the pressure\non the CPU instruction cache. See the `relevant bug\n<https://github.com/simgrid/simgrid/issues/137>`_ on github for\nimplementation leads.\\n\n\nAlso, currently, only the binary is copied and dlopen-ed for each MPI\nrank. We could probably extend this to external dependencies, but for\nnow, any external dependencies must be statically linked into your\napplication. As usual, simgrid itself shall never be statically linked\nin your app. You don't want to give a copy of SimGrid to each MPI rank:\nthat's ways too much for them to deal with.\n\n.. todo: speak of smpi/privatize-libs here\n\n----------------------------------------------\nAdapting your MPI code for further scalability\n----------------------------------------------\n\nAs detailed in the `reference article\n<http://hal.inria.fr/hal-01415484>`_, you may want to adapt your code\nto improve the simulation performance. But these tricks may seriously\nhinder the result quality (or even prevent the app to run) if used\nwrongly. We assume that if you want to simulate an HPC application,\nyou know what you are doing. Don't prove us wrong!\n\n..............................\nReducing your memory footprint\n..............................\n\nIf you get short on memory (the whole app is executed on a single node when\nsimulated), you should have a look at the SMPI_SHARED_MALLOC and\nSMPI_SHARED_FREE macros. It allows one to share memory areas between processes: The\npurpose of these macro is that the same line malloc on each process will point\nto the exact same memory area. So if you have a malloc of 2M and you have 16\nprocesses, this macro will change your memory consumption from 2M*16 to 2M\nonly. Only one block for all processes.\n\nIf your program is ok with a block containing garbage value because all\nprocesses write and read to the same place without any kind of coordination,\nthen this macro can dramatically shrink your memory consumption. For example,\nthat will be very beneficial to a matrix multiplication code, as all blocks will\nbe stored on the same area. Of course, the resulting computations will useless,\nbut you can still study the application behavior this way.\n\nNaturally, this won't work if your code is data-dependent. For example, a Jacobi\niterative computation depends on the result computed by the code to detect\nconvergence conditions, so turning them into garbage by sharing the same memory\narea between processes does not seem very wise. You cannot use the\nSMPI_SHARED_MALLOC macro in this case, sorry.\n\nThis feature is demoed by the example file\n`examples/smpi/NAS/dt.c <https://framagit.org/simgrid/simgrid/tree/master/examples/smpi/NAS/dt.c>`_\n\n.. _SMPI_use_faster:\n\n.........................\nToward Faster Simulations\n.........................\n\nIf your application is too slow, try using SMPI_SAMPLE_LOCAL,\nSMPI_SAMPLE_GLOBAL and friends to indicate which computation loops can\nbe sampled. Some of the loop iterations will be executed to measure\ntheir duration, and this duration will be used for the subsequent\niterations. These samples are done per processor with\nSMPI_SAMPLE_LOCAL, and shared between all processors with\nSMPI_SAMPLE_GLOBAL. Of course, none of this will work if the execution\ntime of your loop iteration are not stable.\n\nThis feature is demoed by the example file\n`examples/smpi/NAS/ep.c <https://framagit.org/simgrid/simgrid/tree/master/examples/smpi/NAS/ep.c>`_\n\n.............................\nEnsuring Accurate Simulations\n.............................\n\nOut of the box, SimGrid may give you fairly accurate results, but\nthere is a plenty of factors that could go wrong and make your results\ninaccurate or even plainly wrong. Actually, you can only get accurate\nresults of a nicely built model, including both the system hardware\nand your application. Such models are hard to pass over and reuse in\nother settings, because elements that are not relevant to an\napplication (say, the latency of point-to-point communications,\ncollective operation implementation details or CPU-network\ninteraction) may be irrelevant to another application. The dream of\nthe perfect model, encompassing every aspects is only a chimera, as\nthe only perfect model of the reality is the reality. If you go for\nsimulation, then you have to ignore some irrelevant aspects of the\nreality, but which aspects are irrelevant is actually\napplication-dependent...\n\nThe only way to assess whether your settings provide accurate results\nis to double-check these results. If possible, you should first run\nthe same experiment in simulation and in real life, gathering as much\ninformation as you can. Try to understand the discrepancies in the\nresults that you observe between both settings (visualization can be\nprecious for that). Then, try to modify your model (of the platform,\nof the collective operations) to reduce the most preeminent differences.\n\nIf the discrepancies come from the computing time, try adapting the\n``smpi/host-speed``: reduce it if your simulation runs faster than in\nreality. If the error come from the communication, then you need to\nfiddle with your platform file.\n\nBe inventive in your modeling. Don't be afraid if the names given by\nSimGrid does not match the real names: we got very good results by\nmodeling multicore/GPU machines with a set of separate hosts\ninterconnected with very fast networks (but don't trust your model\nbecause it has the right names in the right place either).\n\nFinally, you may want to check `this article\n<https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00907887>`_ on the classical pitfalls in\nmodeling distributed systems.\n\n-------------------------\nTroubleshooting with SMPI\n-------------------------\n\n.................................\n./configure refuses to use smpicc\n.................................\n\nIf your ``./configure`` reports that the compiler is not\nfunctional or that you are cross-compiling, try to define the\n``SMPI_PRETEND_CC`` environment variable before running the\nconfiguration.\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n   SMPI_PRETEND_CC=1 ./configure # here come the configure parameters\n   make\n\nIndeed, the programs compiled with ``smpicc`` cannot be executed\nwithout ``smpirun`` (they are shared libraries and do weird things on\nstartup), while configure wants to test them directly.  With\n``SMPI_PRETEND_CC`` smpicc does not compile as shared, and the SMPI\ninitialization stops and returns 0 before doing anything that would\nfail without ``smpirun``.\n\n.. warning::\n\n  Make sure that SMPI_PRETEND_CC is only set when calling ./configure,\n  not during the actual execution, or any program compiled with smpicc\n  will stop before starting.\n\n..............................................\n./configure does not pick smpicc as a compiler\n..............................................\n\nIn addition to the previous answers, some projects also need to be\nexplicitly told what compiler to use, as follows:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n   SMPI_PRETEND_CC=1 ./configure CC=smpicc # here come the other configure parameters\n   make\n\nMaybe your configure is using another variable, such as ``cc`` (in\nlower case) or similar. Just check the logs.\n\n.....................................\nerror: unknown type name 'useconds_t'\n.....................................\n\nTry to add ``-D_GNU_SOURCE`` to your compilation line to get ride\nof that error.\n\nThe reason is that SMPI provides its own version of ``usleep(3)``\nto override it and to block in the simulation world, not in the real\none. It needs the ``useconds_t`` type for that, which is declared\nonly if you declare ``_GNU_SOURCE`` before including\n``unistd.h``. If your project includes that header file before\nSMPI, then you need to ensure that you pass the right configuration\ndefines as advised above.\n\n\n\n.. _SMPI_offline:\n\n-----------------------------\nTrace Replay and Offline SMPI\n-----------------------------\n\nAlthough SMPI is often used for :ref:`online simulation\n<SMPI_online>`, where the application is executed for real, you can\nalso go for offline simulation through trace replay.\n\nSimGrid uses time-independent traces, in which each actor is given a\nscript of the actions to do sequentially. These trace files can\nactually be captured with the online version of SMPI, as follows:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n   $ smpirun -trace-ti --cfg=tracing/filename:LU.A.32 -np 32 -platform ../cluster_backbone.xml bin/lu.A.32\n\nThe produced trace is composed of a file ``LU.A.32`` and a folder\n``LU.A.32_files``. The file names don't match with the MPI ranks, but\nthat's expected.\n\nTo replay this with SMPI, you need to first compile the provided\n``smpi_replay.cpp`` file, that comes from\n`simgrid/examples/smpi/replay\n<https://framagit.org/simgrid/simgrid/tree/master/examples/smpi/replay>`_.\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n   $ smpicxx ../replay.cpp -O3 -o ../smpi_replay\n\nAfterward, you can replay your trace in SMPI as follows:\n\n   $ smpirun -np 32 -platform ../cluster_torus.xml -ext smpi_replay ../smpi_replay LU.A.32\n\nAll the outputs are gone, as the application is not really simulated\nhere. Its trace is simply replayed. But if you visualize the live\nsimulation and the replay, you will see that the behavior is\nunchanged. The simulation does not run much faster on this very\nexample, but this becomes very interesting when your application\nis computationally hungry.\n"
