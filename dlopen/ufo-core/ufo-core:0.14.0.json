Install the MacPorts from http://macports.org\n\n   .. note:: \n   \n       If you previously installed MacPorts, and it can not be started after\n       latest installation. `Error: port dlopen (...`\n       You must download the tar.gz file and install it using a terminal::\n\n           ./configure\n           make\n           sudo make install\n\n2. Install the necessary packages through macports::\n\n       sudo port install glib2\n       sudo port install gtk2\n       sudo port install json-glib\n\n3. Install CMake from http://cmake.org\n\n4. Make ufo-core\n\n   1. Got to the directory ufo-core and run::\n\n       export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig\n       cmake .\n\n   2. Run::\n\n       make\n       sudo make install\n\n   3. Installation is complete, perhaps the last lines are as follows::\n\n       -- Installing: /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/ufo.pc\n       CMake Error at src/bindings/cmake_install.cmake:33 (FILE):\n       file INSTALL cannot find\n         \"/Users/Andrey/Desktop/ufo-distr/ufo-core/src/bindings/../src/Ufo-0.1.gir\".\n       Call Stack (most recent call first):\n         src/cmake_install.cmake:60 (INCLUDE)\n         cmake_install.cmake:32 (INCLUDE)\n       make: *** [install] Error 1\n\n5. Make filters\n\n   1. Go to ufo-filters directory. Now, since libufo was installed in lib64, we must update the paths to look\n   for shared libraries::\n\n       export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib64\n       export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig\n\n   2. Run::\n\n       cmake .\n       make\n       sudo make install\n\n6. Build the test project and verify that everything works.\n\n"
