1.40]\n\nThe 1.41.0 release of Boost adds futures to the thread library. There are also a few minor changes.\n\n[heading Changes since boost 1.35]\n\nThe 1.36.0 release of Boost includes a few new features in the thread library:\n\n* New generic __lock_multiple_ref__ and __try_lock_multiple_ref__ functions for locking multiple mutexes at once.\n\n* Rvalue reference support for move semantics where the compilers supports it.\n\n* A few bugs fixed and missing functions added (including the serious win32 condition variable bug).\n\n* `scoped_try_lock` types are now backwards-compatible with Boost 1.34.0 and previous releases.\n\n* Support for passing function arguments to the thread function by supplying additional arguments to the __thread__ constructor.\n\n* Backwards-compatibility overloads added for `timed_lock` and `timed_wait` functions to allow use of `xtime` for timeouts.\n\n[heading Version 2.0.0 - Changes since boost 1.34]\n\nAlmost every line of code in __boost_thread__ has been changed since the 1.34 release of boost. However, most of the interface\nchanges have been extensions, so the new code is largely backwards-compatible with the old code. The new features and breaking\nchanges are described below.\n\n[heading New Features]\n\n* Instances of __thread__ and of the various lock types are now movable.\n\n* Threads can be interrupted at __interruption_points__.\n\n* Condition variables can now be used with any type that implements the __lockable_concept__, through the use of\n`boost::condition_variable_any` (`boost::condition` is a `typedef` to `boost::condition_variable_any`, provided for backwards\ncompatibility). `boost::condition_variable` is provided as an optimization, and will only work with\n`boost::unique_lock<boost::mutex>` (`boost::mutex::scoped_lock`).\n\n* Thread IDs are separated from __thread__, so a thread can obtain it's own ID (using `boost::this_thread::get_id()`), and IDs can\nbe used as keys in associative containers, as they have the full set of comparison operators.\n\n* Timeouts are now implemented using the Boost DateTime library, through a typedef `boost::system_time` for absolute timeouts, and\nwith support for relative timeouts in many cases. `boost::xtime` is supported for backwards compatibility only.\n\n* Locks are implemented as publicly accessible templates `boost::lock_guard`, `boost::unique_lock`, `boost::shared_lock`, and\n`boost::upgrade_lock`, which are templated on the type of the mutex. The __lockable_concept__ has been extended to include publicly\navailable __lock_ref__ and __unlock_ref__ member functions, which are used by the lock types.\n\n[heading Breaking Changes]\n\nThe list below should cover all changes to the public interface which break backwards compatibility.\n\n* __try_mutex__ has been removed, and the functionality subsumed into __mutex__. __try_mutex__ is left as a `typedef`,\nbut is no longer a separate class.\n\n* __recursive_try_mutex__ has been removed, and the functionality subsumed into\n__recursive_mutex__. __recursive_try_mutex__ is left as a `typedef`, but is no longer a separate class.\n\n* `boost::detail::thread::lock_ops` has been removed. Code that relies on the `lock_ops` implementation detail will no longer work,\nas this has been removed, as it is no longer necessary now that mutex types now have public __lock_ref__ and __unlock_ref__ member\nfunctions.\n\n* `scoped_lock` constructors with a second parameter of type `bool` are no longer provided. With previous boost releases,\n``boost::mutex::scoped_lock some_lock(some_mutex,false);`` could be used to create a lock object that was associated with a mutex,\nbut did not lock it on construction. This facility has now been replaced with the constructor that takes a\n`boost::defer_lock_type` as the second parameter: ``boost::mutex::scoped_lock some_lock(some_mutex,boost::defer_lock);``\n\n* The `locked()` member function of the `scoped_lock` types has been renamed to __owns_lock_ref__.\n\n* You can no longer obtain a __thread__ instance representing the current thread: a default-constructed __thread__ object is not\nassociated with any thread. The only use for such a thread object was to support the comparison operators: this functionality has\nbeen moved to __thread_id__.\n\n* The broken `boost::read_write_mutex` has been replaced with __shared_mutex__.\n\n* __mutex__ is now never recursive. For Boost releases prior to 1.35 __mutex__ was recursive on Windows and not on POSIX platforms.\n\n* When using a __recursive_mutex__ with a call to [cond_any_wait_link `boost::condition_variable_any::wait()`], the mutex is only\n  unlocked one level, and not completely. This prior behaviour was not guaranteed and did not feature in the tests.\n\n[endsect]\n\n[section:future Future]\n\nThe following features will be included in next releases. \n\n# Add some minor features, in particular\n  * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/7589 #7589] Synchro: Add polymorphic lockables.\n\n# Add some features based on C++ proposals, in particular\n  * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/8273 #8273] Synchro: Add externally locked streams.\n  * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/8514 #8514] Async: Add a thread_pool executor with work stealing.\n\n# And some additional extensions related to futures as:\n\n  * [@http://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/8517 #8517] Async: Add a variadic shared_future::then.\n\n\n[endsect]\n\n",

This prevents the same object from being\nwritten to or read from an archive multiple times. These stored addresses\ncan also be used to delete objects created during a loading process\nthat has been interrupted by throwing of an exception.  \n<p>\nThis could cause problems in \nprogams where the copies of different objects are saved from the same address.\n<pre><code>\ntemplate&lt;class Archive&gt;\nvoid save(boost::basic_oarchive  &amp; ar, const unsigned int version) const\n{\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i){\n        A x = a[i];\n        ar &lt;&lt; x;\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\nIn this case, the data to be saved exists on the stack.  Each iteration\nof the loop updates the value on the stack.  So although the data changes\neach iteration, the address of the data doesn't.  If a[i] is an array of\nobjects being tracked by memory address, the library will skip storing\nobjects after the first as it will be assumed that objects at the same address\nare really the same object.\n<p>\nTo help detect such cases, output archive operators expect to be passed\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">const</code> reference arguments.\n<p>\nGiven this, the above code will invoke a compile time assertion.\nThe obvious fix in this example is to use\n<pre><code>\ntemplate&lt;class Archive&gt;\nvoid save(boost::basic_oarchive &amp; ar, const unsigned int version) const\n{\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i){\n        ar &lt;&lt; a[i];\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\nwhich will compile and run without problem.  \nThe usage of <code style=\"white-space: normal\">const</code> by the output archive operators\nwill ensure that the process of serialization doesn't\nchange the state of the objects being serialized.  An attempt to do this\nwould constitute augmentation of the concept of saving of state with\nsome sort of non-obvious side effect. This would almost surely be a mistake \nand a likely source of very subtle bugs.\n<p>\nUnfortunately, implementation issues currently prevent the detection of this kind of\nerror when the data item is wrapped as a name-value pair.\n<p>\nA similar problem can occur when different objects are loaded to an address\nwhich is different from the final location:\n<pre><code>\ntemplate&lt;class Archive&gt;\nvoid load(boost::basic_oarchive  &amp; ar, const unsigned int version) const\n{\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i){\n        A x;\n        ar &gt;&gt; x;\n        std::m_set.insert(x);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\nIn this case, the address of <code>x</code> is the one that is tracked rather than\nthe address of the new item added to the set.  Left unaddressed\nthis will break the features that depend on tracking such as loading an object through a pointer.\nSubtle bugs will be introduced into the program.  This can be\naddressed by altering the above code thusly:\n\n<pre><code>\ntemplate&lt;class Archive&gt;\nvoid load(boost::basic_iarchive  &amp; ar, const unsigned int version) const\n{\n    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; ++i){\n        A x;\n        ar &gt;&gt; x;\n        std::pair&lt;std::set::const_iterator, bool&gt; result;\n        result = std::m_set.insert(x);\n        ar.reset_object_address(& (*result.first), &x);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\nThis will adjust the tracking information to reflect the final resting place of \nthe moved variable and thereby rectify the above problem.\n<p>\nIf it is known a priori that no pointer\nvalues are duplicated, overhead associated with object tracking can\nbe eliminated by setting the object tracking class serialization trait\nappropriately.\n<p>\nBy default, data types designated primitive by the\n<a target=\"detail\" href=\"traits.html#level\">Implementation Level</a>\nclass serialization trait are never tracked. If it is desired to\ntrack a shared primitive object through a pointer (e.g. a\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">long</code> used as a reference count), It should be wrapped\nin a class/struct so that it is an identifiable type.\nThe alternative of changing the implementation level of a <code style=\"white-space: normal\">long</code>\nwould affect all <code style=\"white-space: normal\">long</code>s serialized in the whole\nprogram - probably not what one would intend.\n<p>\nIt is possible that we may want to track addresses even though\nthe object is never serialized through a pointer.  For example,\na virtual base class need be saved/loaded only once.  By setting\nthis serialization trait to <code style=\"white-space: normal\">track_always</code>, we can suppress \nredundant save/load operations.\n<pre><code>\nBOOST_CLASS_TRACKING(my_virtual_base_class, boost::serialization::track_always)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3><a name=\"helpersupport\">Helper Support</a></h3>\nSome types, specially those with complicated lifetime behavior or limited\naccess to their internal state, might need or benefit from elaborate serialization\nalgorithms.  The prinicple motivating case is that of shared_ptr.  As instances\nare loaded, they have to be \"matched up\" with any other instances which have\nalready been loaded.  Thus, a table of previously loaded instances has to be\nmaintained while the archive containing the shared_ptr instances is being loaded.\nWithout maintaining such a table, the shared_ptr would be a serializable type.\n<p>\nTo implement this facility, one declares a <i>helper object</i>\nassociated to the current archive that can be used to store contextual\ninformation relevant to the particular type serialization algorithm.\n\n<pre><code>\ntemplate<class T>\nclass shared_ptr\n{\n   ...\n};\n\nBOOST_SERIALIZATION_SPLIT_FREE(shared_ptr)\n\nclass shared_ptr_serialization_helper\n{\n  // table of previously loaded shared_ptr\n  // lookup a shared_ptr from the object address\n  shared_ptr<T> lookup(const T *);\n  // insert a new shared_ptr\n  void insert<shared_ptr<T> >(const shared_ptr<T> *);\n};\n\nnamespace boost {\nnamespace serialization {\n\ntemplate&lt;class Archive&gt;\nvoid save(Archive &amp; ar, const shared_ptr &amp; x, const unsigned int /* version */)\n{\n    // save shared ptr\n    ...\n}\n\ntemplate&lt;class Archive&gt;\nvoid load(Archive &amp; ar, shared_ptr &amp; x, const unsigned int /* version */)\n{\n    // get a unique identifier.  Using a constant means that all shared pointers\n    // are held in the same set.  Thus we detect handle multiple pointers to the\n    // same value instances in the archive.\n    const void * shared_ptr_helper_id = 0;\n\n    shared_ptr_serialization_helper &amp; hlp =\n        ar.template get_helper&lt;shared_ptr_serialization_helper&gt;(helper_instance_id);\n\n    // load shared pointer object\n    ...\n\n    shared_ptr_serialization_helper &amp; hlp =\n        ar.template get_helper&lt;shared_ptr_serialization_helper&gt;(shared_ptr_helper_id);\n\n    // look up object in helper object\n    T * shared_object hlp.lookup(...);\n\n    // if found, return the one from the table\n\n    // load the shared_ptr data\n    shared_ptr<T> sp = ...\n\n    // and add it to the table\n    hlp.insert(sp);\n    // implement shared_ptr_serialization_helper load algorithm with the aid of hlp\n}\n\n} // namespace serialization\n} // namespace boost\n</code></pre>\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">get_helper&lt;shared_ptr_serialization_helper&gt;();</code>\ncreates a helper object associated to the archive the first time it is invoked;\nsubsequent invocations return a reference to the object created in the first\nplace, so that <code style=\"white-space: normal\">hlp</code> can effectively be\nused to store contextual information persisting through the serialization\nof different <code style=\"white-space: normal\">complex_type</code> objects on\nthe same archive.\n\n<p>\nHelpers may be created for saving and loading archives.\nThe same program might have several different helpers or the same helper instantiated\nseparately from different parts of the program.  This is what makes the helper_instance_id\nnecessary.  In principle it could be any unique integer. In practice it seems\neasiest to use the address of the serialization function which contains it. The\nabove example uses this technique.\n\n<h3><a name=\"classinfo\">Class Information</a></h3>\nBy default, for each class serialized, class information is written to the archive.\nThis information includes version number, implementation level and tracking\nbehavior.  This is necessary so that the archive can be correctly\ndeserialized even if a subsequent version of the program changes\nsome of the current trait values for a class.  The space overhead for\nthis data is minimal.  There is a little bit of runtime overhead\nsince each class has to be checked to see if it has already had its\nclass information included in the archive.  In some cases, even this\nmight be considered too much.  This extra overhead can be eliminated\nby setting the \n<a target=\"detail\" href=\"traits.html#level\">implementation level</a>\nclass trait to: <code style=\"white-space: normal\">boost::serialization::object_serializable</code>. \n<p>\n<i>Turning off tracking and class information serialization will result\nin pure template inline code that in principle could be optimised down\nto a simple stream write/read.</i>  Elimination of all serialization overhead\nin this manner comes at a cost.  Once archives are released to users, the\nclass serialization traits cannot be changed without invalidating the old\narchives.  Including the class information in the archive assures us\nthat they will be readable in the future even if the class definition\nis revised.  A light weight structure such as a display pixel might be\ndeclared in a header like this:\n\n<pre><code>\n#include &lt;boost/serialization/serialization.hpp&gt;\n#include &lt;boost/serialization/level.hpp&gt;\n#include &lt;boost/serialization/tracking.hpp&gt;\n\n// a pixel is a light weight struct which is used in great numbers.\nstruct pixel\n{\n    unsigned char red, green, blue;\n    template&lt;class Archive&gt;\n    void serialize(Archive &amp; ar, const unsigned int /* version */){\n        ar &lt;&lt; red &lt;&lt; green &lt;&lt; blue;\n    }\n};\n\n// elminate serialization overhead at the cost of\n// never being able to increase the version.\nBOOST_CLASS_IMPLEMENTATION(pixel, boost::serialization::object_serializable);\n\n// eliminate object tracking (even if serialized through a pointer)\n// at the risk of a programming error creating duplicate objects.\nBOOST_CLASS_TRACKING(pixel, boost::serialization::track_never)\n</code></pre>\n\n<h3><a name=\"portability\">Archive Portability</a></h3>\nSeveral archive classes create their data in the form of text or a portable binary format.  \nIt should be possible to save such a class on one platform and load it on another.  \nThis is subject to a couple of conditions.\n<h4><a name=\"numerics\">Numerics</a></h4>\nThe architecture of the machine reading the archive must be able hold the data\nsaved.  For example, the gcc compiler reserves 4 bytes to store a variable of type\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">wchar_t</code> while other compilers reserve only 2 bytes.  \nSo it's possible that   a value could be written that couldn't be represented by the loading program.  This is a\nfairly obvious situation and easily handled by using the numeric types in\n<a target=\"cstding\" href=\"../../../boost/cstdint.hpp\">&lt;boost/cstdint.hpp&gt;</a>\n<P>\nA special integral type is <code>std::size_t</code> which is a typedef\nof an integral types guaranteed to be large enough\nto hold the size of any collection, but its actual size can differ depending\non the platform. The \n<a href=\"wrappers.html#collection_size_type\"><code>collection_size_type</code></a>\nwrapper exists to enable a portable serialization of collection sizes by an archive.\nRecommended choices for a portable serialization of collection sizes are to \nuse either 64-bit or variable length integer representation.\n\n\n<h4><a name=\"traits\">Traits</a></h4>\nAnother potential problem is illustrated by the following example:\n<pre><code>\ntemplate&lt;class T&gt;\nstruct my_wrapper {\n    template&lt;class Archive&gt;\n    Archive & serialize ...\n};\n\n...\n\nclass my_class {\n    wchar_t a;\n    short unsigned b;\n    template&lt;class Archive&gt;\n    Archive & serialize(Archive & ar, unsigned int version){\n        ar & my_wrapper(a);\n        ar & my_wrapper(b);\n    }\n};\n</code></pre>\nIf <code style=\"white-space: normal\">my_wrapper</code> uses default serialization\ntraits there could be a problem.  With the default traits, each time a new type is\nadded to the archive, bookkeeping information is added. So in this example, the\narchive would include such bookkeeping information for \n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">my_wrapper&lt;wchar_t&gt;</code> and for\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">my_wrapper&lt;short_unsigned&gt;</code>.\nOr would it?  What about compilers that treat \n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">wchar_t</code> as a\nsynonym for <code style=\"white-space: normal\">unsigned short</code>?\nIn this case there is only one distinct type - not two.  If archives are passed between\nprograms with compilers that differ in their treatment \nof <code style=\"white-space: normal\">wchar_t</code> the load operation will fail\nin a catastrophic way.\n<p>\nOne remedy for this is to assign serialization traits to the template\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">my_template</code> such that class\ninformation for instantiations of this template is never serialized.  This \nprocess is described <a target=\"detail\" href=\"traits.html#templates\">above</a> and\nhas been used for <a target=\"detail\" href=\"wrappers.html#nvp\"><strong>Name-Value Pairs</strong></a>.\nWrappers would typically be assigned such traits.\n<p>\nAnother way to avoid this problem is to assign serialization traits\nto all specializations of the template <code style=\"white-space: normal\">my_wrapper</code>\nfor all primitive types so that class information is never saved.  This is what has\nbeen done for our implementation of serializations for STL collections.\n\n<h3><a name=\"binary_archives\">Binary Archives</a></h3>\nStandard stream i/o on some systems will expand linefeed characters to carriage-return/linefeed \non output. This creates a problem for binary archives.  The easiest way to handle this is to \nopen streams for binary archives in \"binary mode\" by using the flag \n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">ios::binary</code>.  If this is not done, the archive generated\nwill be unreadable.\n<p>\nUnfortunately, no way has been found to detect this error before loading the archive.  Debug builds\nwill assert when this is detected so that may be helpful in catching this error.\n\n<h3><a name=\"xml_archives\">XML Archives</a></h3>\nXML archives present a somewhat special case. \nXML format has a nested structure that maps well to the \"recursive class member visitor\" pattern \nused by the serialization system. However, XML differs from other formats in that it \nrequires a name for each data member. Our goal is to add this information to the \nclass serialization specification while still permiting the the serialization code to be \nused with any archive. This is achived by requiring that all data serialized to an XML archive\nbe serialized as a <a target=\"detail\" href=\"wrappers.html#nvp\">name-value pair</a>.\nThe first member is the name to be used as the XML tag for the\ndata item while the second is a reference to the data item itself. Any attempt to serialize data\nnot wrapped in a in a <a target=\"detail\" href=\"wrappers.html#nvp\">name-value pair</a> will\nbe trapped at compile time. The system is implemented in such a way that for other archive classes,\njust the value portion of the data is serialized. The name portion is discarded during compilation.\nSo by always using <a target=\"detail\" href=\"wrappers.html#nvp\">name-value pairs</a>, it will\nbe guaranteed that all data can be serialized to all archive classes with maximum efficiency.\n\n<h3><a name=\"export\">Exporting Class Serialization</a></h3>\n<a target=\"detail\" href=\"traits.html#export\">Elsewhere</a> in this manual, we have described \n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT</code>. \nExport implies two things:\n<ul>\n<li>Instantiates code which is not otherwise referred to.\n<li>Associates an external identifier with the class to be serialized.\nThe fact that the class isn't explicitly referred to implies this\nrequirement.\n</ul>\nIn C++, usage of code not explicitly referred to is implemented via\nvirtual functions.  Hence, the need for export is implied by the \nusage of a derived class that is manipulated via a pointer or\nreference to its base class.\n\n<p>\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT</code> in the same\nsource module that includes any of the archive class headers will\ninstantiate code required to serialize polymorphic pointers of\nthe indicated type to the all those archive classes. If no\narchive class headers are included, then no code will be instantiated.\n\n<p>\nNote that the implemenation of this functionality requires\nthat the <code style=\"white-space: normal\">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT</code>\nmacro appear <b>after</b> the inclusion of any archive\nclass headers for which code is to be instantiated.\nSo, code that uses <code style=\"white-space: normal\">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT</code>\nwill look like the following:\n<pre><code>\n#include &lt;boost/archive/text_oarchive.hpp&gt;\n#include &lt;boost/archive/text_oarchive.hpp&gt;\n... // other archives\n\n#include \"a.hpp\" // header declaration for class a\nBOOST_CLASS_EXPORT(a)\n... // other class headers and exports\n</code></pre>\nThis will be true regardless of whether the code is part\nof a stand alone executable, a static library or\na dyanmic or shared library.  \n<p>\nIncluding\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT</code>\nin the \"a.hpp\" header itself as one would do with\nother serialization traits will make it difficult\nor impossible to follow the rule above regarding\ninclusion of archive headers before\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT</code>\nis invoked. This can best be addressed by using\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_KEY</code>\nin the header declarations and\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_IMPLEMENT</code>\nin the class definition file.\n\n<p>\nThis system has certain implications for placing code in static or shared\nlibraries.  Placing <code style=\"white-space: normal\">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT</code>\nin library code will have no effect unless archive class headers are\nalso included.  So when building a library, one should include all headers\nfor all the archive classes which he anticipates using. Alternatively,\none can include headers for just the\n<a href=\"archive_reference.html#polymorphic\">Polymoprhic Archives</a>.\n\n<p>\nStrictly speaking, export should not be necessary if all pointer serialization\noccurs through the most derived class.  However, in order to detect\nwhat would be a catastophic error, the library traps ALL serializations through\na pointer to a polymorphic class which are not exported or otherwise registered.\nSo, in practice, be prepared to register or export all classes with one\nor more virtual functions which are serialized through a pointer. \n\n<p>\nNote that the implementation of this functionality depends upon vendor\nspecific extensions to the C++ language.  So, there is no guaranteed portability\nof programs which use this facility.  However, all C++ compilers which\nare tested with boost provide the required extensions.  The library\nincludes the extra declarations required by each of these compilers.\nIt's reasonable to expect that future C++ compilers will support\nthese extensions or something equivalent.\n\n<h3><a name=\"static_libraries\">Static Libraries and Serialization</a></h3>\nCode for serialization of data types can be saved in libraries\njust as it can for the rest of the type implementation.\nThis works well, and can save a huge amount of compilation time.\n<ul>\n<li>Only compile serialization definitions in the library.\n<li>Explicitly instantiate serialization code for ALL\narchive classes you intend to use in the library.\n<li>For exported types, only use <code style=\"white-space: normal\">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_KEY</code>\nin headers.\n<li>For exported types, only use <code style=\"white-space: normal\">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_IMPLEMENT</code>\nin definitions compiled in the library.  For any particular type,\nthere should be only one file which contains\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_IMPLEMENT</code>\nfor that type.  This ensures that only one copy\nof serialization code will exist within the program.  It avoids\nwasted space and the possibility of having different\nversions of the serialization code in the same program.\nIncluding\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">BOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_IMPLEMENT</code>\nin multiple files could result in a failure\nto link due to duplicated symbols or the throwing\nof a runtime exception.\n<li> Code for serialization should be only in the library,\n<li>Familiarize yourself with the <b>PIMPL</b> idiom.\n</ul>\nThis is illustrated by\n<a href = \"../example/demo_pimpl.cpp\" target=\"demo_pimpl\">\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">demo_pimpl.cpp</code>\n</a>,\n<a href = \"../example/demo_pimpl_A.cpp\" target=\"demo_pimpl\">\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">demo_pimpl_A.cpp</code>\n</a>\nand\n<a href = \"../example/demo_pimpl_A.hpp\" target=\"demo_pimpl\">\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">demo_pimpl_A.hpp</code>\n</a>\nwhere implementation of serializaton is in a static library \ncompletely separate from the main program.\n\n<h3><a name=\"dlls\">DLLS - Serialization and Runtime Linking</a></h3>\nSerialization code can be placed in libraries to be linked at runtime.  That is,\ncode can be placed in DLLS(Windows) Shared Libraries(*nix), or static libraries\nas well as the main executable.  The best technique is the\nsame as that described above for libraries.  The serialization\nlibrary test suite includes the following programs\nto illustrate how this works:\n<p>\n\n<a href = \"../test/test_dll_simple.cpp\" target=\"test_dll_simple\">\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">test_dll_simple</code>\n</a>,\nand\n<a href = \"../test/dll_a.cpp\" target=\"dll_a\">\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">dll_a.cpp</code>\n</a>\nwhere implementation of serializaton is also completely separate\nfrom the main program but the code is loaded at runtime.  In this\nexample, this code is loaded automatically when the program which\nuses it starts up, but it could just as well be loaded and unloaded \nwith an OS dependent API call.\n<p>\nAlso included are\n<a href = \"../test/test_dll_exported.cpp\" target=\"test_dll_exported\">\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">test_dll_exported.cpp</code>\n</a>,\nand\n<a href = \"../test/polymorphic_derived2.cpp\" target=\"polymorphic_derived2\">\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">polymorphic_derived2.cpp</code>\n</a>\nwhich are similar to the above but include tests of the export\nand no_rtti facilities in the context of DLLS.\n<p>\nFor best results, write your code to conform to the following\nguidelines:\n<ul>\n  <li>Don't include <code>inline</code> code in classes used in DLLS.\nThis will generate duplicate code in the DLLS and mainline. This\nneedlessly duplicates code.  Worse, it makes is possible for \ndifferent versions of the same code to exist simultaneously.  This\ntype of error turns out to be excruciatingly difficult to debug.\nFinally, it opens the possibility that a module being referred to\nmight be explictly unloaded which would (hopefully) result in\na runtime error. This is another bug that is not always \nreproducible or easy to find. For class member templates use something like\n\n<pre><code>\ntemplate&lt;class Archive&gt;\nvoid serialize(Archive & ar, const unsigned int version);\n</code></pre>\nin the header, and\n\n<pre><code>\ntemplate&lt;class Archive&gt;\nvoid myclass::serialize(Archive & ar, const unsigned int version){\n\t...\n}\n\nBOOST_CLASS_EXPORT_IMPLEMENT(my_class)\n\n#include &lt;boost/archive/text_oarchive&gt;\n#include &lt;boost/archive/text_iarchive&gt;\ntemplate myclass::serialize(boost::archive::text_oarchive & ar, const unsigned int version);\ntemplate myclass::serialize(boost::archive::text_iarchive & ar, const unsigned int version);\n... // repeat for each archive class to be used.\n</code></pre>\nin the implementation file.  This will result in generation of all code\nrequired in only one place.  The library does not detect this type of error for you.\n  <li>If DLLS are to be loaded and unloaded explicitly (e.g. using <code>dlopen</code> in *nix or \n<code>LoadLibrary</code> in Windows).  Try to arrange that they are unloaded in the reverse\nsequence.  This should guarantee that problems are avoided even if the\nabove guideline hasn't been followed.\n\n</ul>\n\n<h3><a name=\"plugins\">Plugins</a></h3>\nIn order to implement the library, various facilities for runtime\nmanipulation of types at runtime were required.  These\nare <a target=\"detail\" href=\"extended_type_info.html\"><code>extended_type_info</code></a>\nfor associating classes with external identifying strings (<b>GUID</b>)\nand <a target=\"detail\" href=\"void_cast.html\"><code>void_cast</code></a>\nfor casting between pointers of related types.\n\nTo complete the functionality of \n<a target=\"detail\" href=\"extended_type_info.html\"><code>extended_type_info</code></a>\nthe ability to construct and destroy corresponding types has been\nadded.  In order to use this functionality, one must specify\nhow each type is created.  This should be done at the time\na class is exported.  So, a more complete example of the code above would be:\n\n<pre><code>\n#include &lt;boost/archive/text_oarchive.hpp&gt;\n#include &lt;boost/archive/text_oarchive.hpp&gt;\n... // other archives\n\n#include \"a.hpp\" // header declaration for class a\n\n// this class has a default constructor\nBOOST_SERIALIZATION_FACTORY_0(a)\n// as well as one that takes one integer argument\nBOOST_SERIALIZATION_FACTORY_1(a, int)\n\n// specify the GUID for this class\nBOOST_CLASS_EXPORT(a)\n... // other class headers and exports\n</code></pre>\n\nWith this in place, one can construct, serialize and destroy a class\nabout which is known only the <b>GUID</b> and a base class.\n\n\n<h3><a name=\"multi_threading\">Multi-Threading</a></h3>\nThe fundamental purpose of serialization would conflict with multiple \nthreads concurrently writing/reading from/to a single open archive instance.\nThe library implementation presumes that the application avoids such a situtation.\n<p>\nHowever, Writing/Reading different archives simultaneously\nin different tasks is permitted as each archive instance is (almost) \ncompletely independent from any other archive instance.  The only shared \ninformation is some type tables which have been implemented using a \nlock-free thread-safe \n<a target=\"detail\" href=\"singleton.html\">\n<code style=\"white-space: normal\">singleton</code>\n</a>\ndescribed elsewhere in this documentation.\n<p>\nThis singleton implementation guarantees that all of this shared\ninformation is initialized when the code module which contains\nit is loaded.  The serialization library takes care to\nensure that these data structures are not subsequently\nmodified. The only time there could be a problem would\nbe if code is loaded/unloaded while another task is\nserializing data.  This could only occur for types whose \nserialization is implemented in a dynamically loaded/unloaded DLL\nor shared library.  So if the following is avoided:\n<ul>\n    <li>Accessing the same archive instance from different tasks.\n    <li>Loading/Unloading DLLS or shared libraries while any archive\n    instances are open.\n</ul>\nThe library should be thread safe.\n\n<h3><a name=\"optimizations\">Optimizations</a></h3>\nIn performance critical applications that serialize large sets of contiguous data of homogeneous\ntypes one wants to avoid the overhead of serializing each element individually, which is\nthe motivation for the <a href=\"wrappers.html#arrays\"><code>array</code></a>\nwrapper.\n\nSerialization functions for data types containing contiguous arrays of homogeneous\ntypes, such as for <code>std::vector</code>, <code>std::valarray</code> or  \n<code>boost::multiarray</code> should serialize them using an\n<a href=\"wrappers.html#arrays\"><code>array</code></a> wrapper to make use of \nthese optimizations.\n\nArchive types that can provide optimized serialization for contiguous arrays of \nhomogeneous types should implement these by overloading the serialization of\nthe  <a href=\"wrappers.html#arrays\"><code>array</code></a> wrapper, as is done\nfor the binary archives.\n\n\n<h3><a href=\"exceptions.html\">Archive Exceptions</a></h3>\n<h3><a href=\"exception_safety.html\">Exception Safety</a></h3>\n\n<hr>\n<p><i>&copy; Copyright <a href=\"http://www.rrsd.com\">Robert Ramey</a> 2002-2004. \nDistributed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0.

On other platforms it\nis not safe to concurrently call any of the functions from Boost.DLL (even a `shared_library::location()` call triggers a race condition).\nSee [link boost_dll.limitations.multithread Limitations, Thread safe library loading].\n\n[pre\n]\n\n* [*Question:]  Why on Linux symbols from one plugin are seen in another? Can't get symbol with same name from right plugin!\n  * [*Answer:]  You've run into the symbol shadowing problem. Compile your plugins with \"-fvisibility=hidden\"\nflag and take a look to the Tutorial section.\n\n[pre\n]\n\n* [*Question:]  How Unicode (Windows) is handled?\n  * [*Answer:]  Boost.DLL supports Unicode, so that you could provide Unicode paths to it.\n\n[pre\n]\n\n* [*Question:]  Can I open an executable file?\n  * [*Answer:]  Yes, you can. Symbols need be exported using in the executable using `BOOST_SYMBOL_EXPORT`\nor `BOOST_DLL_ALIAS`. You can call `shared_library(program_location())` to load yourself. Refer to\nthe Tutorial section for more info. You can also query executables, just provide a path to the executable\nto `library_info` class.\n\n[pre\n]\n\n* [*Question:]  What if I specify wrong type in `shared_library::get<T>` or `import<T>`?\n  * [*Answer:]  Usually you'll end up with `Segmentation Fault`. However it is safe to make types\nmore strict, for example making `const int` from an `int` will not harm.\n\n[pre\n]\n\n* [*Question:]  Does your library guarantee ABI stability of methods?\n  * [*Answer:]  Library only guarantees that alias names created using the `BOOST_DLL_ALIAS` macros\nwill not change with the change of compiler or platform. You must take care of functions ABI and API\nstability by your own.\n\n[pre\n]\n\n* [*Question:]  Are there any function signature restrictions for the exported/imported functions?\n  * [*Answer:]  No. You may import/export functions with any signature and any return parameter.\n\n[pre\n]\n\n* [*Question:]  I have 2 plugins that use same shared library. Would be the shared library loaded twice?\n  * [*Answer:]  No. Pugins will share the shared library instance.\n\n[pre\n]\n\n* [*Question:]  I have 2 plugins each of them must work with it's own version of `libsome_library` shared library. How to achieve that?\n  * [*Answer:]  Avoid such situations by statically linking in the libsome_library into each plugin and loading plugins with `load_mode::rtld_deepbind`.\n\n[pre\n]\n\n* [*Question:]  How to load a shared object from memory??\n  * [*Answer:]  All existing OS avoid loading shared libraries directly from userspace memory, so you'll find no syscall for such case. Currently Boost.DLL provides no means for honest loading shared objects from memory. This requires reimplementing dynamic linker logic in userspace for all the platforms, which is a huge amount of work and very error-prone. However working patches are welcomed!\n\nWorkaround would be to write plugin into a temporary file in RAM and load plugin from it:\n```\n#include <boost/filesystem.hpp>\n#include <boost/dll.hpp>\nusing namespace boost;\n\ndll:shared_library load_from_memory(unsigned char* data, std::size_t size, const filesystem::path& tmp_plugin_path = filesystem::unique_path() / \"libplugin.so\") {\n    const filesystem::path plugin_location = filesystem::temp_directory_path() / tmp_plugin_path;\n    filesystem::create_directories(plugin_location.parent_path());\n    filesystem::ofstream ofs(plugin_location, std::ios::out|std::ios::bin|std::ios::trunc);\n    ofs.write(data, size);\n\n    return dll::shared_library(plugin_location);\n}\n```\n\nBut there's no guarantee that `filesystem::temp_directory_path()` will actually write to RAM, that's very platform dependent.\n\n[pre\n]\n\n* [*Question:] Can I use function pointer type (like `void(*)()`) instead of function type (like `void()`) to import function?\n  * [*Answer:] No you can't because the meaning of importing a function pointer is different:\n    * `lib.get<void()>(\"func\")` imports a function `void func()`\n    * `lib.get<void(*)()>(\"func_var\")` imports a variable that stores a pointer to the function `auto func_var = &func`\n\n[pre\n]\n  \n* [*Question:]  I have found a bug, how do I notify?\n  * [*Answer:]  Create an [@https://github.com/apolukhin/Boost.DLL/issues issue at GitHub] with a detailed description.\n\n[endsect]\n\n\n\n",
