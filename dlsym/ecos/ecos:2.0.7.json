Davis. http://www.suitesparse.com\n\nLDL: a sparse LDL' factorization and solve package.\n    Written in C, with both a C and MATLAB mexFunction interface. \n\nThese routines are not terrifically fast (they do not use dense matrix kernels),\nbut the code is very short and concise.  The purpose is to illustrate the\nalgorithms in a very concise and readable manner, primarily for educational\npurposes.  Although the code is very concise, this package is slightly faster\nthan the built-in sparse Cholesky factorization in MATLAB 6.5 (chol), when\nusing the same input permutation.\n\nRequires SuiteSparse_config, in the ../SuiteSparse_config directory relative to\nthis directory.\n\nQuick start (Unix, or Windows with Cygwin):\n\n    To compile, test, and install LDL, you may wish to first obtain a copy of\n    AMD v2.0 from http://www.suitesparse.com and place it in the\n    ../AMD directory, relative to this directory.  Next, type \"make\", which\n    will compile the LDL library and three demo main programs (one of which\n    requires AMD).  It will also compile the LDL MATLAB mexFunction (if you\n    have MATLAB).  Typing \"make clean\" will remove non-essential files.\n    AMD v2.0 or later is required.  Its use is optional.\n\nQuick start (for MATLAB users);\n\n    To compile, test, and install the LDL mexFunctions (ldlsparse and\n    ldlsymbol), start MATLAB in this directory and type ldl_install.\n    This works on any system supported by MATLAB.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nLDL License:\n\n    Your use or distribution of LDL or any modified version of\n    LDL implies that you agree to this License.\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
